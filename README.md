# Rails Todo
A rails todo application built for educational purposes!

Rails version: 5.1.4

Ruby version: 2.3.3 (i386-mingw32)

## Technologies Used
* The HTML Abstraction Markup Language (haml) is used as the templating engine instead of the default Embedded RuBy (erb) engine (similar but much cleaner)
