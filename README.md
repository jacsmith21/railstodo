# Rails Todo
A rails todo application built for educational purposes!

Rails version: 5.1.4

Ruby version: 2.3.3 (i386-mingw32)

## Building
1. `$ git clone github.com/jacsmith21/railstodo`
2. `$ cd railstodo`
3. `$ bundle install`
4. `$ rails server`

> Assuming you have git, ruby, rails and bundler installed

## Technologies Used
* The HTML Abstraction Markup Language (haml) is used as the templating engine instead of the default Embedded RuBy (erb) engine (similar but much cleaner)
* .scss files are used instead of .css
